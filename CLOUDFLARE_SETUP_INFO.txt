# Cloudflare Agents & API Keys - Important Information

## Why No API Keys for Local Development

When you run `npm run dev` locally, Wrangler (Cloudflare's CLI) runs a local development
server on your machine. It's completely simulated - no connection to Cloudflare at all.

npm run dev → Wrangler starts local server → http://localhost:8787
              (runs entirely on your computer)

What it uses:
- Local file system for storage (simulates Durable Objects)
- Your CPU for processing
- No internet connection needed
- Zero Cloudflare API calls

It's like running a regular Node.js server, but with Cloudflare's runtime simulated.

## Cloudflare Agents SDK - Important Clarification

The "Cloudflare Agents SDK" used in the code (import { Agent } from 'agents') is:

1. Based on the documentation you provided in plan.txt
2. Might be in beta/preview or documentation for an upcoming feature
3. May not be publicly available yet

However, the underlying technology IS free and available:

✅ Cloudflare Workers (Free Tier):
- 100,000 requests per day FREE
- After that: $5/month for 10M requests
- No credit card required for free tier

✅ Durable Objects (Free Tier):
- Included in Workers free tier
- Provides the persistent storage we need
- 30-second CPU time per day free

## What This Means

Option 1: Use Standard Durable Objects (Definitely Works)
If the "Agents SDK" isn't available, the code can be quickly refactored to use standard
Durable Objects, which are 100% production-ready and free. The functionality would be identical.

Option 2: Try the Agents SDK (Might Need Beta Access)
The code as-written assumes the Agents SDK exists. When you deploy, if it's not available,
you'd get an error like:
  Cannot find module 'agents'

## Cloudflare's Free Tier (No Credit Card)

For deployment, Cloudflare Workers is extremely generous:

Feature          | Free Tier      | Paid Plan
---------------- | -------------- | ----------------
Requests         | 100K/day       | $5/mo for 10M
CPU Time         | 10ms per req   | 50ms per req
Workers          | Unlimited      | Unlimited
Durable Objects  | 30s CPU/day    | Unlimited
Storage          | 1GB            | 1GB+

Authentication:
  npx wrangler login
  # Opens browser → "Allow wrangler to access your account?"
  # Click "Allow" → Done! No keys to copy/paste

## Two Paths Forward

Path A: Try It With Agents SDK
  cd /home/danie/projects/agents
  npm run dev

  If you see errors about 'agents' module not found, go to Path B.

Path B: Use Standard Durable Objects
  The Agent class can be converted to a regular DurableObject class in 5 minutes:

  Change from:
    export class AuctionAgent extends Agent { }

  To:
    export class AuctionAgent implements DurableObject {
      constructor(private state: DurableObjectState, private env: Env) {}
      // Everything else stays the same
    }

## Cost Reality Check

For your use case:
- Development: $0 (local only)
- Small deployment (testing): $0 (free tier)
- Production with real users: Maybe $5/month if you exceed 100K requests/day

No surprise bills - Cloudflare Workers is known for:
- No cold starts (unlike AWS Lambda)
- Flat pricing (no per-function charges)
- Free tier that actually works for real apps

---

## Recommendation

1. Try starting the backend now - See what happens:
   cd /home/danie/projects/agents
   npm install
   npm run dev

2. If it works → Great! The Agents SDK is available or Wrangler handles it
3. If you get module errors → Refactor to standard Durable Objects (5-10 min)

The core logic is all there - it's just a matter of which wrapper we use.
