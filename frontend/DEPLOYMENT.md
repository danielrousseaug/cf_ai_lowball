- ✅ API endpoints properly configured
- ✅ All imports and file paths verified
- ✅ Next.js configuration optimized
- ✅ ESLint errors fixed

## Deploying to Vercel

### Option 1: Using Vercel CLI

1. Install Vercel CLI (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Login to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. Deploy from the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

4. Follow the prompts. For production deployment:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Option 2: Using Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import your Git repository
3. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js settings
4. Add environment variable:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: `https://reverse-auction-coordinator.danielrousseaug.workers.dev`
5. Click "Deploy"

## Environment Variables

The following environment variable must be set in Vercel:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://reverse-auction-coordinator.danielrousseaug.workers.dev
```

This is already configured in `vercel.json` but you may want to verify it in the Vercel dashboard.

## Build Configuration

The project uses:
- **Framework**: Next.js 16.0.0
- **Node Version**: (Vercel will auto-detect from package.json)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `.next`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

All configuration is in `vercel.json`.

## Post-Deployment

After deployment:
1. Verify the application loads correctly
2. Test the chat functionality
3. Verify API connectivity to the Cloudflare Workers backend
4. Check all pages render correctly

## Current Backend URL

The backend is already deployed at:
```
https://reverse-auction-coordinator.danielrousseaug.workers.dev
```

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check Vercel build logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure the backend URL is accessible
4. Check that all dependencies are in package.json (not just devDependencies)

## Local Testing

To test the production build locally:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000
