# Lowball
![unnamed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cb5dfba-5716-46fc-91c1-b46701a0de41)

**Bid low, win tasks** - the marketplace where lowest bidder wins.

A reverse auction platform where users bid down for undesirable tasks. The person willing to do it for the least compensation wins.

## What is it?

Instead of traditional auctions where prices go up, Lowball reverses the model:

1. Someone posts a task: "Clean the bathroom"
2. Users bid down: $20 â†’ $18 â†’ $15 â†’ $12
3. Lowest bidder wins and completes the task
