# Lowball

**Bid low, win tasks** - the marketplace where lowest bidder wins.

A reverse auction platform where users bid down for undesirable tasks. The person willing to do it for the least compensation wins.

## What is it?

Instead of traditional auctions where prices go up, Lowball reverses the model:

1. Someone posts a task: "Clean the bathroom"
2. Users bid down: $20 → $18 → $15 → $12
3. Lowest bidder wins and completes the task
