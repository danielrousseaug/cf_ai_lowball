This is a project meant to use Cloudflare Agents, the main point of the project is to demonstrate usage
of CloudFlare agents and as such using them extensively should be a focus

Project Guidelines:

Reverse Auction Coordinator - Deep Dive
Core Concept
Instead of bidding up for things people want, users bid down for tasks nobody wants to do. The person willing to do it for the least compensation (money, points, or favors) wins the "privilege" of doing the task.
How It Works
Task Creation Flow:

Someone posts an undesirable task: "Clean the shared bathroom"
Sets a starting "payment" (e.g., $20, 200 points, or 2 favor tokens)
Sets auction duration (e.g., 24 hours)
Optional: Add verification requirements (photo proof, peer confirmation)

Bidding Mechanics:

Users underbid each other: "I'll do it for $18" → "I'll do it for $15" → "I'll do it for $12"
Optional "Buy It Now" price for urgent tasks ("I need this done NOW for $30")
Last-minute bidding protection (extends auction by 5 minutes if bid comes in final minute)
Reverse Dutch auction variant: Price automatically decreases over time until someone accepts

Advanced Features
Multi-Currency System:

Cash: Direct payment between users
Chore Points: Internal currency earned by doing tasks
Favor Tokens: "I owe you one" system - can be redeemed to force task assignment
Time Banks: "I'll do 30 minutes of your tasks if you do 30 minutes of mine"

Reputation & Gamification:

Reliability Score: Did they complete tasks on time?
Quality Rating: How well was it done? (peer reviewed)
Bidding History: Are they a fair player or do they always bail?
Achievements: "Bathroom Hero" (10 bathroom cleans), "Night Owl" (takes late-night tasks)
Leaderboards: Weekly/monthly rankings by points earned or tasks completed

Smart Scheduling:

Agent learns user patterns: "Sarah usually bids on weekend tasks"
Predictive notifications: "Based on history, this task will likely go for $8-12"
Auto-bidding: "Automatically bid on dishwasher duties if price goes above $5"
Task bundling: "Take all three bathroom tasks this week for a 20% bonus"

Technical Implementation with Cloudflare Agents
Persistent State Management:
javascriptclass AuctionAgent extends Agent {
  state = {
    auctions: Map<taskId, AuctionDetails>,
    userProfiles: Map<userId, Profile>,
    completionHistory: Array<CompletedTask>,
    currencyBalances: Map<userId, Balances>
  }
}
Scheduled Operations:

Check auction endings every minute
Send daily digest of new tasks
Weekly reputation score updates
Monthly settlement of point balances

Real-time Features:

WebSocket connections for live bid updates
Push notifications for outbid alerts
Instant messaging between task poster and winner

Monetization Ideas

Premium Groups: Advanced features for paid teams
Task Insurance: Pay small fee to guarantee someone will do it
Express Tasks: Pay extra to get tasks done within hours
Arbitration Service: Resolve disputes about task completion

Psychological Hooks
Loss Aversion: "You're about to lose this easy $10 task to someone else!"
Social Pressure: Everyone can see who hasn't done tasks in a while
Gambler's Thrill: The excitement of winning a bidding war (even for chores)
Fairness Mechanism: No more arguing about who "always" does certain tasks - the market decides
Potential Expansions
